## Usage

In order to make the project your own, you will need to:

* edit the `config/index.js` (config module) file to export your links (make them **your** links)
* preserve the object format
* it exports as JSON and will build out both the available routes for redirection and the UI dynamically

## History

I already had a short domain name that's unique to my name space, so I thought I would try and set up something like a URL shortener. While there are other packages out there, I didn't find any projects of any recent flavor that ran in node, my current runtime of choice. This doesn't use a back-end to store the data, unless you cound a js module as an object as a flat file. In the future, I may add more functionality.
